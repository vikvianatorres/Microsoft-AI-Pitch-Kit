# Microsoft-AI-Pitch-Kit
We have developed the resources in this repository to help our business partners to start the conversation about Microsoft IA using partner ready material and pre-built demonstrations.

Here you are going to find a powerpoint deck, three tutorials on "how to" deploy Pre-Built AI and Custom AI demostrations and a link to the PFD of our "The Future Compute" review.

# Getting Started

Powerpoint Deck

In the totally cuztomizable deck, we present the main aspects of Microsoft AI Strategy, our commitment to Ethics in AI, our azure plataform machine learning layercake, some success cases and reference architectures. This may be useful in order to engage your customer in a AI practice with you.

To envision the capabilities of Microsoft AI, we also deliver 4 types of demonstrations.

Microsoft AI integrated to Microsoft 365

Realtime subtittles for Powerpoint
  
Through an integration to our Microsoft Speech to text and Transalation Cognitive services Microsoft Powerpoint can create an AI experience where while the someone is speaking it can listen to what is said and write in 20 different languages.

These instructions will get you install a Translation Add-in for Powerpoint and start your session with a real time subtittle experience.
