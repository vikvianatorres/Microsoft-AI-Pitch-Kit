# Microsoft-AI-Pitch-Kit
We have developed the resources in this repository to help our business partners to start the conversation about Microsoft IA using partner ready material and pre-built demonstrations.

Here you are going to find a PowerPoint deck, three tutorials on "how to" deploy Pre-Built AI and Custom AI demonstrations and a PDF deck with all the public links to the resources for this pitch.

We hope you can take advantage of this AI Pitch Kit and it helps you to consolidate an AI practice with Microsoft.
